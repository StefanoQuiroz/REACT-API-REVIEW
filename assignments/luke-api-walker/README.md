# Luke APIwalker

You have been assigned a task as a front-end developer to create an application to navigate the Star Wars API. 

By reading the documentation, create a user interface that performs the following tasks:

1. Create a drop-down menu that allows the user to choose the resource they are looking for.
2. Next to the drop-down menu, create an input field that accepts a number that will be used to query a specific ID.
3. Add a button to allow them to send a request to the API.
4. If the request is successful, send at least four attributes that were returned by the API.
5. If the request is unsuccessful, create an error message that says "These are not the droids you are looking for" with an image of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
6. Also, it creates a route so that when it goes to localhost: 3000 /: id, it shows the person with the ID in the URL
NINJA BONUS: If the resource is "people", type in the name of their home world (you may have to make another request).
