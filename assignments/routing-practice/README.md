# Routing practice

Create a simple React application that can handle the following routes:

1. localhost: 3000 / home: this should display the home page, with a generic "Welcome" header.

2. Create localhost: 3000/4: This should display the number "4", or whatever number has been sent.

3. Create localhost: 3000 / hello: This should display the word "hello" or any other word that was sent.

4. localhost: 3000 / hello / blue / red: This should display the word "hello" in blue text with a red background. It should work with any other valid words and colors.

Hint: use theisNaN method (not a number). For example: isNaN(+"35")is false, isNaN(+"hello")istrue
